# LinearSolver
This project is done with the help of Gabriele Fumagalli (reach him at https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-fumagalli-08053b339/)

A Python library implementing different iterative methods to solve a linear system.

Solving techniques are implemented in the "linSolving.py" library, which includes four different algorithms:
Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Gradient and Conjugate Gradient.

"progetto1bis.py" is a simple script where a linear system of choice is solved through the 4 different methods implemented in the library for comparison purpose.
